        "5. **Depth Fusion**: Merge depth maps into a dense point cloud\n",
        "6. **Meshing**: Convert the point cloud into a mesh\n",
        "\n",
        "By understanding this pipeline, we can identify which stages are most relevant for fixing the observed issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "We have checked the parameters <a href=\"https://github.com/mwtarnowski/colmap-parameters\">here</a>.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Parameter Analysis by Pipeline Stage\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Feature Extraction\n",
        "\n",
        "We assumed that low-texture areas do not contain enough detected keypoints, which leads to missing matches. COLMAP uses SIFT to detect keypoints at different scales.\n",
        "\n",
        "To increase the number of detected keypoints, especially in low-texture regions, we changed the following parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`num_octaves`: 4 --> 5**\n",
        "  Adding an extra octave allows SIFT to detect larger-scale features. This can help in areas where fine details are missing, like in the flat walls.\n",
        "<!--\n",
        "* **`octave_resolution`: 3 -> 4**\n",
        "  Increasing the number of scales per octave enables more precise scale sampling, which can help detect features that would otherwise be skipped.\n",
        "-->\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`peak_threshold`: 0.0067 --> 0.006**\n",
        "  We lower this threshold to make SIFT more sensitive to low-contrast features, which are common in flat or weakly textured regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Feature Matching\n",
        "\n",
        "Even when more keypoints are detected, matching them in low-texture regions is still difficult because descriptors can look very similar. To address this, we enabled:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`guided_matching`: 0 --> 1**\n",
        "  As recommended by the COLMAP tutorial, we enable guided matching, which uses the estimated epipolar geometry to search for additional matches. This helps find valid matches that descriptor-only matching might not find.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Sparse Reconstruction (Mapper)\n",
        "\n",
        "The sparse reconstruction step estimates camera poses and 3D points incrementally. We modified:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`ba_refine_principal_point`: 0 --> 1**\n",
        "  Enabling this option allows bundle adjustment to optimize the principal point, which can slightly improve camera calibration accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "We think this change is not critical to improving the reconstruction, but can help marginally.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Dense Stereo (PatchMatch)\n",
        "\n",
        "Dense stereo is the most important stage for fixing the holes in walls and floors. PatchMatch compares image patches across views to estimate depth.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`window_radius`: 5 --> 7**\n",
        "  This increases the patch size from $11 \\times 11$ to $15 \\times 15$ pixels. Larger patches provide more context, which helps find patch matches in low-texture areas. We beleive this parameter is critical in fixing the missing parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Depth Fusion\n",
        "\n",
        "During depth fusion, depth estimates from multiple images are combined into a single dense point cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`min_num_pixels`: 5 --> 3**\n",
        "  By lowering this threshold we allow points supported by only 3 views to be kept. This results in a denser point cloud, especially in regions supported by very few views.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Poisson Meshing\n",
        "\n",
        "Poisson meshing is used to create a surface from the point cloud.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **`depth`: 13 --> 10**\n",
        "  Using a lower depth produces a smoother mesh and reduces artifacts caused by noisy points, helping to close small remaining gaps. This causes the issue of potentially losing fine scene detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, our parameter changes follow these principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Detect more keypoints in difficult areas\n",
        "2. Recover additional matches using geometry\n",
        "3. Allow reconstruction to start with fewer matches\n",
        "4. Use larger patches for more reliable depth estimation\n",
        "5. Keep more points during fusion\n",
        "6. Apply smoother meshing to reduce artifacts\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these changes significantly reduce holes and missing regions in the final reconstruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Post-processing\n",
        "Although the reconstruction quality was improved by adjusting the parameters described above, the result was still not perfect. For this reason, we applied a post-processing stage using MeshLab in order to further enhance the final reconstruction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our objective was to combine the improved **Poisson mesh** with the **Delaunay mesh** to obtain a more complete surface and to fill the missing regions present in the reconstruction. \n",
        "\n",
        "* First, isolated regions were removed from both meshes using the Remove Isolated Pieces (w.r.t. Diameter) filter, and remaining artifacts were manually deleted. \n",
        "* Then, the Delaunay mesh was smoothed using the `HC Laplacian Smoothing filter` to obtain a smoother and more regular surface.\n",
        "* Afterwards, color information from the Poisson mesh was transferred to the Delaunay mesh using `Sampling > Vertex Attribute Transfer`.\n",
        "* Finally, both meshes were merged into a single model using `Filters > Mesh Layer > Flatten Visible Layers`.\n",

        "The train/test metrics reveal significant overfitting to the training views, with the effect varying substantially across scenes:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Brick (highest overfitting):** Despite achieving the best training metrics (40.47 dB), the Brick scene generalizes worst to test views (16.03 dB). This 24 dB gap suggests severe overfitting. With only 23 images of a small object, the Gaussians likely memorized specific viewpoints rather than learning a consistent 3D representation. The text duplication artifacts observed qualitatively align with this-the optimization placed redundant Gaussians that look correct from training angles but fail from novel views.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Person (moderate overfitting):** The Person scene drops from 36.98 dB to 19.93 dB (Δ = 17 dB). The subject's movement during capture (noted in the qualitative analysis as causing head appearance artifacts) likely contributes to this gap-inconsistent geometry across training frames leads to a representation that cannot generalize coherently to held-out views.\n",
        "\n",
        "**UPF (best generalization):** Despite having the lowest training PSNR (28.36 dB), the UPF scene exhibits the smallest train/test gap (7.34 dB) and the best test PSNR (21.02 dB). This is somewhat counterintuitive given the scene's complexity (outdoor, vegetation, ghost pedestrians). However, with 55 images covering a large area, the training set likely provides better viewpoint coverage relative to the test views. The scene's large scale may also regularize the optimization, preventing extreme overfitting to individual views.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight:** Lower training error does not imply better reconstruction quality. The simpler scenes (Brick, Person) achieve excellent training metrics by memorizing viewpoints, while the complex UPF scene-forced to learn a more general representation due to scene diversity-actually generalizes better to novel views.\n",
        "\n",
        "For improved generalization, one could consider:\n",
        "- Capturing more images with greater viewpoint diversity\n",
        "- Using video capture for denser temporal sampling\n",
        "- Applying regularization techniques designed to prevent overfitting\n",
        "- For scenes with moving subjects (Person), ensuring the subject remains completely static\n",
